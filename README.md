Data and scripts for SIFamide LPG intrinsic bursting manuscript

Spike2 scripts contain analysis code for analyzing raw data in Spike2. Scripts were written by Dirk Bucher and Wolfgang Stein, with some of my modifications (LPG slow script).

MATLAB scripts were written by myself and are for plotting data.

Excel files contains metadata for all experiments and contains files numbers for raw data files that were analyzed. Also contains metadata for statistical analysis. Tabs are either labeled by manipulations and condition (i.e. Riluzole_PDhype) or parameter measured (ie, PIR). Metadata is labeled by raw data file, including experimenter initials, date (xx month, xx day, xx year), and file number (ie, rrs032220_03). Raw data files can be obtained by emailing Dawn (blitzdm@miamioh.edu)  Raw data is in the form of Spike2 (.smrx) files.
